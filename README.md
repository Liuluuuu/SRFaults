# Understanding Transaction-Reverting Faults in Smart Contracts
This project aims to provide a benchmark for smart contract developers and researchers to enhance their understanding of transaction-reverting faults (TR faults) in smart contracts.
The project is associated with a paper titled <b>Understanding Transaction-Reverting Faults in Smart Contracts</b>.

(ðŸŒŸ<i>The paper is currently undergoing review and will be released in the near future</i>.)


## Dataset Description 
### Overview
We identify 301 real-world TR faults from open-source GitHub project and categorize them into machine auditable and machine unauditable faults. 
Among these faults, 224 (74.4%) fall into the machine auditable category, while the remaining 77 (25.6%) fall into the machine unauditable category. For detailed information on these 301 TR fault contracts, please refer to the `/contracts` folder.

### Folder Structure
The dataset is structured into four distinct sections within the `/contracts` directory:
+ [/machine_auditable_faults](/contracts/machine_auditable_faults): includes the buggy and patched version of the 224 machine auditable faults.
+ [/machine_unauditable_faults](/contracts/machine_unauditable_faults): includes the buggy and patched version of the 77 machine unauditable faults.
+ [/machine_auditable_faults.csv](/contracts/machine_auditable_faults.csv): contains the detailed information of each machine auditable fault, including the commit URL, category, and project type.
+ [/machine_unauditable_faults.csv](/contracts/machine_unauditable_faults.csv): contains the detailed information of each machine unauditable fault, including the commit URL, category, and project type.
